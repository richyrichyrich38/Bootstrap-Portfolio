## Description

I wanted to build a personal portfolio site as close to the feel of my orginal that would be easy on the eye, minimalistic with a fluid design that is responsive to various screen sizes and devices but this time integrate as much bootstrap as possible without hurting the aesthetics of the design.

Once again I used orangered to complement the orange sunset background image I used which I also layered with an opacity of black to give it an end of dusk/early evening feel allowing it to not pull focus from the content written in solid white and bold placed orangered accents but his time I also broke up the page with clean white and black sections giving it a minimalistic feel without removing the warmth.

It was very challenging trying to get bootstrap to adjust to my ideas without the functionality going hayewire but I feel I learned a lot from all the trial and error. I also learned to not get too comfortable as the moment I thought it was all going great, it suddenly wasn't. 

My biggest test I would say was the project section containing the cards as while I got everything else to behave correctly and collapse responsively into eachother when the screen size was shrinking, the cards would just bleed into the other sections causing the whole page to look awful. I tried what I feel was 1000 different ways of trying to make it work over many hours until I decided to build a brand new one at the bottom of my code from scratch, confirmed the fuctionality worked, and swap it out for the original section. I'm trying to be positive and look at it as character building!

My biggest takeaway from this challenge is to give myself more stringent time constraints as I feel I could have saved myself a mountain of stress if just done a rebuild after a couple of hours of attempted problem solving
